# üñ•Ô∏è Operating Systems Lab Assignments (OS_LAB_ASSIGN)

This repository contains all of my Operating Systems Lab assignments completed as part of my coursework.  
Each task demonstrates core OS concepts like process management, system calls, file descriptors, and more.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

| File/Folder                | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `task1.py`                 | Demonstrates **basic process creation** using `fork()` or equivalent system calls. |
| `task2.py`                 | Implements **process synchronization** concepts such as semaphores or mutex.       |
| `task3.py`                 | Works with **inter-process communication (IPC)** using pipes or message queues.   |
| `task4.py`                 | Inspects **process information** using the `/proc` filesystem (PID, exe path, file descriptors). |
| `task5.py`                 | Simulates **CPU scheduling algorithms** such as FCFS, SJF, or Round Robin.         |
| `ASSIGNMENT1.OS.pdf`       | PDF submission of Assignment 1 (theory + practical write-up).                       |
